Here some notes what I've done since the first demo: (I didn't listed each tiny detail...)


- Created beamers. Now you could pass large distances in a few seconds.
- There's now another enemy: The X3-scout which walks through the levels
- Included an cheats menu in the configuration dialog which could be activated, if the program 
  was startet with the right parameter
- Added an credits screen in the main menu
- Added level decoration. You could now place md2-models into your level to improve the optic quality
- Added multitexturing, now the textures could be blended smoothly to cover the quadrate level field structure
- Included an enemy called 'Mobmob'. This enemy walks silly around, but if the player comes to near he attacks him.
  The player could kill him in different ways: Kill him with a box, shot on him...
- Added an water environment texture which reflects the sky-box
- The number of objects the player receive if he collects something could now be changed
- Each field could now have different occurrences. For instance: if the player go on a field then a camera or 
  text script could start to give him some information
- Added a text script system which allows to create messages with a picutre/animation to exlpain the 
  player what's going on or to tell an story
- A small message at the top of the screen inform the player about different stuff.
  For instance if he collects something or an mission is complete...
- Included animated player and weapon skin
- You could now open the options in the game, too. (e.g. if you want to see the used keys)
- In the key setup menu you could now see the selected key for each action
- Camera improvement: The camera is now never in a wall or a hill, it rotate now if the camera would be
  in such an obstacle. That was no problem... only some 'simple' mathematic functions...
- Each surface has now an own friction. On sand for example the player is slower and on
  ice his faster...
- Created a Convey loader program which is something like a portal to the game. From there you could
  choose some stuff like the editor or the help. Further it check's the installed DirectX
  version and gives out a message if there is an wrong version. And there's an parameter line
  in which you could type in different program parameters. Short: A nice tool!!
- On an alcove (checkpoint) the game makes an autosave. If you done something wrong then you could
  reload the autosave.
- A particle shadow of the players model signs now the active alcove were the player could restart
  the game.
- Surfaces could now change by time, for example it's possible to creat
  color painters which change their color so that the player have to wait 
  till there's the right color.
- Included an publisher and AblazeSpace logo animation
- The box docking is now smoother and the a box is only after .5 seconds 
  on a anchor docked.
- Included a menu in the game were you could select different options
  Now you could easy restart a level or campaign.
- It appears now a question if the player want to delete a player ID
- The font in the main menu is now animated
- I improved the music playback functions, now this file-types are possible as background music: 
  >> wav, mpa, mp2, mp3, au, aif, aiff, mid, midi, rmi <<
  Further I included a music volume control in the configuration.
- Included transparent surfaces, now it's possible to creat transparent walls and floors.
- Included particles for the player shot, weapon smoke, water waves, air bubbles if the player is under water,
  speed mode and the ghost mode.
  The last are amazing because they creat a trace of the player. In the configuration dialog
  you could setup the particle density. (for slower systems)
- In the editor-missions menu you could now see the number of points which are in the level
- The collision detection is now better
- Rebuild the whole structure of the level information... that was very hard work!
  That should be fix some bugs...
- Fixed many bugs and improved a lot of thing's
